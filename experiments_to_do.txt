    The length of the window and the step used to move the window
For this in loa_data we need to change the size(checked with two one is 30 and other is 50)
------------------------------------
    The size of the input file (use for example the small data file)
Use any one of the text file and run instead of (entire file)
---------------------------------------------------------------
    The type of RNN (LSTM, GRU, SimpleRNN)
Currently everything is done by LSTM, so change to GRU and simple RNN
-------------------------------------------------------------
    The dropout
dropout of 0.2 is used as of now
----------------------------------------------
    The number of layers
tested with three, more experiments are needed
--------------------------------------
    Batch size
1000 and 256 are used , taking tooooo long time
--------------------------------------
    Number of epochs
10,100 and 1000 are used less than or equla to 100 repetition is happening 
----------------------------------------------------
    Use other optimizer like SGD, RMSprop or adagrad
